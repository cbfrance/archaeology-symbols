**Participatory Iconography**

As part of our recent work in indonesia, HOT has been working to develop a set of map icons that represent the regional Point os Interest. 

Indonesian architecture is different; therefore we need an updated symbology to represent them. 

The existing map iconography is in some places not culturally relevant

The history of symbology...

We used gerd arntz's isotype school to show...

Pictorams vs ideograms...
                            
Our strategy for developing the icons is participatory.

We did the icon development workshop as part of our introductory mapping workshop. This gave everyone a better sense of exactly what we would be mapping, and how the icons related to these Points of Interest.
